# Auditorial Complex
To be blunt, it's a terrible file downloader.

Most of the work was done by [jordiisepic](https://github.com/jordiisepic), with some things (like name and most of the ideas) done by me.

## Development
Download [this](https://www.componentace.com/data/distr/zf.net_305.msi), as it's required to unzip packs. Then you can start development.
